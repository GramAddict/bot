Liking and following automatically on your Android phone/tablet. No root required: it works on [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2), which is a faster and more efficient fork of the official Android UI testing framework [UI Automator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-automator). This is a completely free and open source project that is forked from the freemium project [Insomniac](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/). You can check them out, but you'll probably like us better. ðŸ˜Š

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

### How to install
1. Clone project: `git clone https://github.com/GramAddict/bot.git gramaddict`
2. Go to GramAddict folder: `cd gramaddict`
3. (Optionally) Use virtualenv or similar to make a virtual environment `virtualenv -p python3 .venv` and enter the virtual environment `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install required libraries: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Download and unzip [Android platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), move them to a directory where you won't delete them accidentally, e.g.
```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Android/sdk
mv <path-to-downloads>/platform-tools/ ~/Library/Android/sdk
```
6. [Add platform-tools path to the PATH environment variable](https://github.com/GramAddict/bot/wiki/Adding-platform-tools-to-the-PATH-environment-variable). If you do it correctly, terminal / command prompt command `adb devices` will print `List of devices attached`
7. Run the script `python3 run.py --blogger-followers username`

### How to install on Raspberry Pi OS
1. Update apt-get: `sudo apt-get update`
2. Install ADB and Fastboot: `sudo apt-get install -y android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot`
3. Clone project: `git clone https://github.com/GramAddict/bot.git gramaddict`
4. Go to GramAddict folder: `cd gramaddict`
5. (Optionally) Use virtualenv or similar to make a virtual environment `virtualenv -p python3 .venv` and enter the virtual environment `source .venv/bin/activate`
6. Install required libraries: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
7. Run the script `python3 run.py --blogger-followers username`


### Get started
1. Connect Android device to your computer with a USB cable
2. Enable [Developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) on the device
>On Android 4.1 and lower, the Developer options screen is available by default. On Android 4.2 and higher, you must enable this screen. To enable developer options, tap the Build Number option 7 times. You can find this option in one of the following locations, depending on your Android version:
>
> Android 9 (API level 28) and higher: Settings > About Phone > Build Number
>
> Android 8.0.0 (API level 26) and Android 8.1.0 (API level 26): Settings > System > About Phone > Build Number
>
> Android 7.1 (API level 25) and lower: Settings > About Phone > Build Number
3. Switch on **USB debugging** (and **Install apps via USB** if there is such option) on the Developer options screen.
4. Device will ask you to allow computer connection. Press "Connect"
5. Type `adb devices` in terminal. It will display attached devices. There should be exactly one device. Then run the script (it works on Python 3):
```
cd <path-to-project>/gramaddict
python run.py --blogger-followers <username1> <username2> ...
```
Make sure that the screen is turned on and device is unblocked. You don't have to open Instagram app, script opens it and closes when it's finished. Just make sure that Instagram app is installed. If everything's fine, script will open each blogger's followers and like their posts.

Full list of filters:
```
  "skip_business"             If it is true, business acounts won't be interacted.
                              (e.g. "skip_business": true)
  "skip_non_business"         If it is true, private accounts and public accounts won't be interacted.
                              (e.g. "skip_non_business": true)

  "min_followers"             It is the lower follower bound for an account that can be interacted.
                              If an account has less followers than this amount, it wont be interacted. 
                              (e.g. "min_followers": 100)

  "max_followers"             It is the upper follower bound for an account that can be interacted.
                              If an account has more followers than this amount, it wont be interacted. 
                              (e.g "max_followers": 1000)

  "min_followings"            It is the lower following bound for an account that can be interacted.
                              If an account has less followings than this amount, it wont be interacted. 
                              (e.g. "min_followings": 300)
  
  "max_followings"            It is the upper following bound for an account that can be interacted.
                              If an account has more followings than this amount, it wont be interacted. 
                              (e.g. "max_followings": 800)

  "min_potency_ratio"         These provides us to filter accounts according their followers/followings ratio.
  "max_potency_ratio"         If an account's followers/following ratio is not between these ratios, 
                              it won't be interacted. You don't have to set both of them though. You can just
                              set min_potency or just max_potency. Their default values are 0 and 999.
                              (e.g. EXACC has 500 followers and 1000 followings. That means its ratio is 0.5 
                              If you set your "min_potency_ratio": 0.2 and 
                              "max_potency_ratio": 0.7 It will be interacted.)
  
  "follow_private_or_empty"   If it is false, private accounts or public accounts 
                              that has no posts won't be interacted. 
                              (e.g. "follow_private_or_empty": false)

  "interact_only_private"     If it is set to true, only private accounts will be interacted with. 
                              No public accounts will be interacted with.
                              (e.g. "follow_only_private": true)

  "min_posts"                 You can specify the minumum post number that an account should have. 
                              (e.g. "min_posts": 7)

  "max_digits_in_profile_name"  You can set a upper digit bound so that accounts which have more digits 
                                than the limit won't be interacted.
                                (e.g. "max_digits_in_profile_name": 4)

```

### FAQ
- How to stop the script? _Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac)_
- Can I prevent my phone from falling asleep while the script is working? _Yes. Settings -> Developer Options -> Stay awake._
- With the new feature _--screen-sleep_ you can forget about keeping your screen always on: the script will turn it on and off for you.
  Attention: this function is intended to work only if you don't have a passcode for unlock your phone!

### Why GramAddict?
There already is [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy), which works on Instagram web version. Unfortunately, Instagram bots detection system has become very suspicious to browser actions. Now InstaPy and similar scripts work at most an hour, then Instagram blocks possibility to do any actions, and if you continue using InstaPy, it may ban your account. There is also [Insomniac](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/) which is the origin of this project, but there were issues that cropped up when the project organizers decided to monetize it. We wanted to keep this project completely free and open source so we forked it!

Our objective is to make a free solution for mobile devices. Instagram can't distinguish bot from a human when it comes to your phone. However, even a human can reach limits when using the app, so don't fail to be careful. Always set `--total-likes-limit` to 300 or less. Also it's better to use `--repeat` to act periodically for 2-3 hours, because Instagram keeps track of how long the app works.

### Community
We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9MTjgs8g5R) which is the most convenient place to discuss all bugs, new features, Instagram limits, etc.
